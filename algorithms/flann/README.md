FLANN - Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors
======================================================

FLANN is a library for performing fast approximate nearest neighbor searches in high dimensional spaces. This is a modified version of Flann. The original version can be found form  [here](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~mariusm/flann). FLANN is written in C++ and contains bindings for the following languages: C, MATLAB and Python. We only evaluate the C++ results.

Main differences:
1.
